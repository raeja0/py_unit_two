Walk in the Light, wherever you may be, Walk in the Light, wherever you may be! In my old leather breeches and my shaggy, shaggy locks, I am walking in the glory of the Light, said Fox. With a book and a steeple and a bell and a key they would bind it for ever- but they can't, said he. O, the book, it will perish, and the steeple will fall, But the Light will be shining at the end of it all. Walk in the Light, wherever you may be, Walk in the Light, wherever you may be! In my old leather breeches and my shaggy, shaggy locks,I am walking in the glory of the Light, said Fox.If we give you a pistol, will you fight for the Lord? You can't kill the devil with a gun or a sword.Will you swear on the Bible? I will not, said he,For the truth is as holy as the Book to me. Walk in the Light, wherever you may be, Walk in the Light, wherever you may be! In my old leather breeches and my shaggy, shaggy locks, I am walking in the glory of the Light, said Fox. There's an ocean of darkness and I drowned in the night Till I came through the darkness to the ocean of Light; You can lock me in prison but the Light will be free. And I'll walk in the glory of the Light, said he. Walk in the Light, wherever you may be! Walk in the Light, wherever you may be! In my old leather breeches and my shaggy, shaggy locks,I am walking in the glory of the Light, said Fox.")
